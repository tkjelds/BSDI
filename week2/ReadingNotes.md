## Business model generation Kapitel 1

Defintion af business model

    "A business model describes the rationale of how an organization creat, delivers and captures value"

Four mian areas of business

    Customers
    Offer 
    Infrastructure 
    Finincial viability

Business model is like a blueprint for a strategy to be implemented through organizational structures, processes, and systems.

### Customer Segments

Customers are the heart of any business model.
Customers can be grouped into different segements with common needs, behaviors or other attributes.
Customer segments can be of any size, it is the conscious decision of the company to make the customer segments. And which ones to serve and which ones to ignore.

Customer groups represent separate segments if:

    • Their needs require and justify a distinct offer
    • They are reached through different Distribution Channels
    • They require different types of relationships
    • They have substantially diferent profitabilities
    • They are willing to pay for different aspects  of the offer

Business models focused on mass markets don’t distinguish between different Customer Segments.
Business models targeting niche markets cater to specific, specialized Customer Segments
Some business models may differentiate between certain custommer segments with slighty different needs and problems. (an example of this would be a bank, where they differentiate between customers based on how much money they have. As such those customers have different needs and problmes.)
An organization with a diversified customer business model serves two unrelated Customer Segments with very different needs and problems. (An example of this is amazon, with their hosting service and consumer product market service)

### Value Propositions

Value proposition describes the bundle of products and services that create value for a specific customer segment.
It solves problems for the customer or satisfies a need.
Value, in itself may be quantitative (price or speed) or qualitative (design).

Elements that may provide value to a customer

    Newness (Newness of the category of products, solving problems the customer did not know that they had)
    Performance
    Customization (customized products, co-creation)
    "Getting the job done" (focuses on getting a certain job done, so a consumer can continue)
    Design
    Brand/Status (Louis vutton)
    Price
    Cost reduction
    Riks reduction
    Accessibility (Provide access to products)
